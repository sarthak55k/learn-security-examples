The vulnerability lies in the ability to freely modify a user's status without proper authentication checks in the code. This flaw allows non-admin users to potentially downgrade the status of an admin user by simulating or manipulating their role. Attackers could employ a brute-force strategy to repeatedly attempt different roles until they successfully impersonate an admin, exploiting the absence of rigorous authentication to alter user roles unauthorizedly.

To address this issue, robust authentication measures are necessary. Implementing sessions, creating a login and registration system, and other forms of user verification can significantly mitigate the risk. Additionally, incorporating two-factor authentication can provide an extra layer of security, ensuring that merely possessing login credentials is not enough to make critical changes to user statuses.

In the secure version, the system validates the user's ID within an active session and employs middleware to generate a secure session ID. This approach ensures that only authenticated users, whose identities have been verified as part of an ongoing session, can make changes to user statuses. By securing the session management process and requiring session validation for sensitive operations, the system effectively guards against unauthorized role changes, thereby addressing the core vulnerability.
